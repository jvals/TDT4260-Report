Grann√¶s(2010)~\cite{grannaes2010} proposes a solution combining the benefits if
Reference Prediction Table and Global History Buffer called \textit{Delta
Correlating Prediction Tables (DCPT)}. It stores many ``Deltas'' or ``Strides''
in the same entry and updates it whenever the accessed address is different from
the last accessed address. This reduces the memory usage while keeping the good
characteristics of both RPT and GHB.
