\subsection{The Simulator}

All simulations have been executed on the M5 simulator, running on a
virtual machine provided by IDI~\cite{idi}.  The M5 baseline
configuration has a two-level cache. L1 is split into a 32 KiB
instruction cache and a 64 KiB data cache. L2 is a combined 1 MiB
cache. All prefetching is done for the L2 cache. Each cache line has a
size of 64 B. The bus connecting cache to memory is 64 bits wide and
has a latency of 30 ns. The frequency of the bus is 400 MHz.

The M5 simulates Alpha 21264 which is a four-issue superscalar
architecture with out-of-order execution. Alpha is able to have up to
80 instructions in partial states of completion at any
time~\cite{kessler_1999}.
