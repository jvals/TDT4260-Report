\section{Conclusion} % Summary and significance

% Repeating the goal and the main results
% Possible impact of the proposed solution

The implemented prefetchers shows relatively simple prefetchers can
make a difference. We showed how our implemented RTP gets a good
overall performance and does not score poorly in any test. From the
tests with sequential prefecthers we can see that a very simple
configuration we can get noticable results on specific tasks. It might
be something to consider for device designers if the task is very
specific and performance is important, otherwise the overhead is
likely to large. For multi--purpose computers
like the desk- and laptops of today the more complicated prefetchers
could be considered.
