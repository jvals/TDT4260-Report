% Repeating the goal and the main results
% Possible impact of the proposed solution

The implemented prefetchers show that relatively simple prefetchers
can make a difference. We showed how our implementation of RPT gets a
good overall performance and does not score poorly in any test. From
the tests with sequential prefecthers we can see that a very simple
configuration can get noticeable results on specific tasks. It might
be something to consider for device designers if the task is very
specific and performance is important, otherwise the overhead is
probably too large. For multi--purpose computers like the desktops and
laptops of today, more complicated prefetchers could be considered.
