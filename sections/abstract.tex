For a long time, processors have been getting faster while memory has
lagged behind. One technique which alleviates this bottleneck is
called prefetching, which is to make a guess at what memory addresses
you need next, and fetch these addresses ahead of time.  In this

report, we experiment with simple prefetcher schemes as well as
    present an implementation of the Reference Prediction Table (RPT)
    and Global History Buffer (GHB) prefetcher algorithms. These implementations achieves 9 \%
speedup (over no prefetching) during simulation in the M5 system. This
is 3 \% better than the reference implementation of RPT in SPEC2000.
