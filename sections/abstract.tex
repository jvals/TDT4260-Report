For a long time, processors have been getting faster while memory has
lagged behind. One technique which leviates this bottleneck is called
prefetching, which is to make a guess at what memory addresses you
need next, and fetch these addresses ahead of time.
In this this report, we present an implementation of the Reference
Prediction Table prefetcher algorithm. This implementation of RPT
achieves 8 \% speedup (over no prefetching) during simulation in the
M5 system. This is 2 \% better than the reference implementation of RPT.
